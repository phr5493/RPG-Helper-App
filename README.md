Realm/Territory simulator
    
    Make a living world
    Simulator might be done by desktop and then have a client?
      Needs map of area (using hexs) and info of realms
      Determine what realms are active
        Realms that are inactive will only advance economically slowly over time
      Run through the “realm turns” from the Birthright campaign setting
      Save actions to a sort of timeline
   

Random generator for names (and I think other things right?)

    Store and retrieve a certain hex map
      Edit hex map to add details to it
      Each hex has:
      Ruler & faction
        Random Encounter table
        City
        Ruler & faction
        
        Districts
          Ruler & faction
      Have the ability to randomly generate things, if you don’t want to come up with names/identifiers

Local event simulator?
  
    Multi-roll things
      Have a timeline (that can be added and is also linked to #1), and a “time advancement” tool
      Utility mini-apps, such as a wilderness travel tool
